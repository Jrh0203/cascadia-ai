# V3 Performance Notes

These are engineering measurements and diagnostics, not promotion evidence.

## Tensor Export

Rust-native greedy tensor export on `john0`:

| Format | 1,024 games wall time | Size |
|---|---:|---:|
| Deflated `.npz` | 1:35.36 | 71,413,962 bytes |
| Stored `.npz` | 18.28 s | 1,248,396,657 bytes |

Stored shards were `5.22x` faster and `17.48x` larger in that benchmark. Use
stored shards when GPU input throughput matters and disk headroom exists. Use
deflated shards for archival or transport.

## Prefilter Findings

The p80x2 vanilla public-token transformer prefilter family produced a useful
serving signal but did not justify K16 promotion:

- dedicated fixed 3-seed vanilla public-token ensemble:
  - K16 recall `0.7672`;
  - oracle regret `0.1146`.
- 4 paired complete-game pilot:
  - K16 prefilter search `96.0625`;
  - full-32 sampled search `95.0625`;
  - shadow full-search winner retained on `77.8125%` of decisions.
- 20-seed non-shadow follow-up:
  - K16 prefilter search `95.4625`;
  - full-32 sampled search `96.3500`;
  - mean decision time `2.3558s` vs `4.4617s`;
  - `1.89x` speedup and `47.2%` time reduction.

Interpretation: the bridge and prefilter path work, but K16 is too lossy on
current evidence. Prefer K24 or a stronger retention/search-aware model.

## CascadiaFormer Baseline

The first relation-tail CascadiaFormer-S run completed, but no-search play was
below greedy:

| Menu | Policy | Q | Greedy |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| K256 | 72.5125 | 57.4750 | 87.3375 |
| K32 | 82.7625 | 77.9250 | 87.3375 |

The corrected greedy-state K32 retention run was much closer:

- locked validation greedy top-1: `0.6780`;
- 100-game model mean: `86.7800`;
- greedy mean: `87.5875`;
- paired delta: `-0.8075`;
- exact greedy-action match: `67.3625%`.

Interpretation: CascadiaFormer can operate near the greedy policy surface, but
it has not yet surpassed greedy. The next strength test is EI-0 search bootstrap
with corrected Q semantics and search-improved greedy retention.
